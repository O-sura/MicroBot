#  Microbot
[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=python,pytorch)](https://skillicons.dev)
<br>
Project Microbot is a lightweight implementation of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline designed for answering questions about microservices. The project demonstrates the integration of retrieval and generation models to build an efficient Q&A system, with optimizations for GPU acceleration.

## Features

- **RAG Pipeline:** Combines a retrieval mechanism with a generative model to enhance Q&A capabilities.
- **Optimized for Speed:** Achieves at least a 5x speedup when using GPU compared to CPU.
- **Focus on Microservices:** Tailored for domain-specific Q&A tasks related to microservices.
- **Extensible:** Modular design for easy customization and extension.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook
- GPU-enabled environment (optional but recommended for speedup)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/project-microbot.git
   cd project-microbot
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Launch the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook RAG_Notebook.ipynb
   ```

## Usage

1. Open the notebook `RAG_Notebook.ipynb` in Jupyter.
2. Run the cells step by step to:
   - Load or preprocess your dataset.
   - Configure the retrieval and generation models.
   - Evaluate the RAG pipeline on sample questions.
3. Experiment with switching between CPU and GPU to observe performance differences.
